## 🧠 Core Philosophy

CairoVibe is **not a luxury guide**.  
It is a **youth-centered urban culture knowledge graph** expressed as static pages.

LLMs are used to:
- surface trending spots
- cluster venues by vibe & budget
- translate slang & context
- generate night-out itineraries

Humans are required to:
- validate safety & accuracy
- protect local culture
- avoid overexposure of fragile scenes
- keep the vibe real

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

CairoVibe is built around **urban lifestyle entities**.

### Core Entities
- Neighborhood
- Venue (Bar / Café / Club)
- Restaurant / Street Food Spot
- Hotel / Hostel
- Event / Scene
- Vibe Category
- Price Tier
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links socially and geographically
- is programmatically generatable
